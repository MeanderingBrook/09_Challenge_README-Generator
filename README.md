## Description

The README Generator is a Node.js Command-Line Interface (CLI) based application that enables Users to quickly and professionally create Project README files, in Markdown (.md) format by answering a simple string of questions regarding the User's Project.  

The README Generator programatically creates README files with content determined by User responses to questions associated with the individual sections of a model README, and enhances the generated Markdown file with similarly programattically-generated colored badges, and URL references.

The README Generator ensures consistency of generated output, through programmatically-standardized specifications defined by the User questionnaire, and makes available the output Markdown file in a defined (predictable) location and file format that enables automated ingestion to, or use through and end-point application.

As developed, the README Generator is only accessible through a local instance, specific to each accessing computer.

Artifacts (README Markdown files) generated through local instances of the README Generator will be available to all Users of the install computer, held in on-device storage and, consequently, not currently accessible through the Web unless deployed as a component of an online application or other end-point.

The README Generator source code is published on GitHub, and may be cloned to individual User computers to instantiate local versions.

The app utilizes a Node.js CLI-based (Inquirer Module) Form to ingest User requirements input, and JavaScript (mediated by Node) to generate local Markdown file output. 

Because the README Generator output files are held in on-device storage, generated artifacts, though not Inquirer-mediated questionnaire responses themselves, will persist across User sessions on individual, hosting computers.


## Installation

The README Generator source code may be downloaded from its GitHub repository, and run directly by a hosting computer.

No Installation of the SVG Logo Generator itself is required.

However, local computers must hold an installation of Node.js in order the run the README Generator application.


## Usage

The README Generator is intended for use by one or more Users to generate README files, in Markdown format, specific to User-selected requirements (i.e., README content) identified through a CLI-based questionaire, and maintain the locally-generated Markdown file artifacts which persist across multiple sessions. 

All Users of the README Generator on a local computer will have full access to all generated artifacts.
