## Description

The README Generator is a Node.js Command-Line Interface (CLI) based application that enables Users to quickly and professionally create Project README files, in Markdown (.md) format by answering a simple string of questions regarding the User's Project.  

The README Generator enhances the generated Markdown file with programattically-generated colored badges, and URL references.


The Dashboard places accurate, timely Weather information at Users' fingertips, utilizing the industry-leading Weater information of OpenWeather through responsive through flexible OpenWeather APIs.

As developed, the Weather Dashboard is only accessible through a local instance, specific to each accessing computer.

Weather Dashboard data is "live," through active refreshes using OpenWeather APIs, but historical location Searches, are held in the Local Storage and, consequently, not currently accessible through the Web.

The Weather Dashboard source code is published on GitHub, and may be cloned to individual User computers to instantiate local versions.

Weather Dashboard historical location Searches are recorded through a City search entry form availabe in the Dashboard itself and aggregated and displayed in the Dashboard sidebar UI.

The app utlizes an HTML-based Form to ingest User search input, JavaScript to push location Searches to Local Storage, and dynamically update the Dashboard with new Search locations, and CSS to style the site. JavaScript is also used to drive OpenWeather API calls, and responsive behavior, such as Search history display updates.

Because the Weather Dashboard is held in Local Storage, location Search entries will persist across User sessions on individual, hosting computers.


## Installation

The Weather Dashboard source code may be downloaded from its GitHub repository, and run directly by a hosting computer.

No Installation of the Weather Dashboard is required; the app is fully browser-based, accessed through any modern browser that supports JavaScript.


## Usage

The Weather Dashboard is intended for use by one or more Users to view personalized Weather information specific to User-selected locations (Cities) and maintain a quick-access history of location Searches that will be held locally, persisting across multiple sessions. 

All Users of the Weather Dashboard on a local computer will have full visibility to all Dashboard location Searches.
